## Description

Game that requires the user to reorder historical events in 60 sec.

- The game has 6 rounds and the user receives correct points only for fully correctly ordered events.
- At the end, the user can see its score and decide to play again.
- If the user has ended reordering the events and the timer is yet running, the user can shake the device in order to end the round and verify whether the order is correct or not. This is indicated
- The order in which the events must be ordered in from the oldest on the top (first event on the top) to th most recent on the bottom (first label on the bottom)

## TODO:

- Not required: but good to play a sound when round ends
- Not required: initial presentational screen to explain how to use the app (what is the order of the events)
- Refactor : button unvalidation code
